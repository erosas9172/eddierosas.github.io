  <h1>Welcome to my Web Mapping Portfolio!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>[Your Name]</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    This is a very basic first page for my website, which I will be building as part of the GIS course.
  </p>

  <p>Here are a few things I might include later:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Links to my web mapping projects</li>
    <li>Information about my skills and experience</li>
    <li>A way to contact me</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Stay tuned for updates!</strong>
